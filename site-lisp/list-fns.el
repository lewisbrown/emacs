KEY-LIST should be a list of nested keys, if ALIST is an alist of alists.
If any key is not present in an alist, the key and value pair will be
inserted into the parent alist, unless the optional 3rd argument
IGNORE-IF-NEW is non-`nil'.

The optional 4th argument ASSQ-OR-ASSOC should be the symbol `assq' or
`assoc', depending on which kind of search should be done on members of
KEY-LIST.  If not specified, `assq' is used when a key is a symbol,
`assoc' otherwise.

Optional 5th argument APPEND non-`nil' means new values should be appended
to the end of the alist.  The default is to insert new elements at the
front of the alist since that is faster.

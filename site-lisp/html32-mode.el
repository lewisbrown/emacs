;;; -------------------------------- REQUIRES --------------------------------
;;;
;;; HTML32 mode requires easymenu.el for providing the menu. One
;;; version of easymenu.el is part of GNU Emacs. It supports at least
;;; GNU Emacs. But there exists another easymenu.el version (by Per
;;; Abrahamsen) which supports also other emacs version than GNU
;;; Emacs. You can disable the easymenu menu by setting the variable
;;; html32-using-easymenu to nil.
;;;
;;; You are assumed to be at least somewhat familiar with the HTML
;;; format.  If you aren't, read about it first.
;;;
;;; ------------------------------ INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------------
;;;
;;; Put the following code in your .emacs file:
;;;
;;; (autoload 'html32-mode "html32-mode" "HTML major mode." t)
;;; (or (assoc "\\.html$" auto-mode-alist)
;;;   (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.html$" . html32-mode) 
;;;                               auto-mode-alist)))
;;; (or (assoc "\\.shtml$" auto-mode-alist)
;;;   (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.shtml$" . html32-mode) 
;;;                               auto-mode-alist)))
;;; (or (assoc "\\.htm$" auto-mode-alist)
;;;   (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.htm$" . html32-mode) 
;;;                               auto-mode-alist)))
;;;
;;; Emacs will detect ".html", ".shtml" and ".htm" suffixes and
;;; activate html32-mode appropriately.

;;; ------------------------------- KNOWN BUGS -------------------------------
;;;
;;; <TITLE>Emacs HTML 3.2 Mode - Source Code</TITLE>
;;; (The line above is needed by our site map script, because it
;;;  always found the "..." in the example beyond as title of the
;;;  document when generating the site map. :-)
;;;
;;; The mode is a little bit slow on some machines when fontifying big
;;; files.
;;;  
;;; ------------------------------ WHAT HTML IS ------------------------------
;;;
;;; HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a format for hypertext
;;; documents, particularly in the World Wide Web (WWW).  For more
;;; information on HTML go to http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/ at the
;;; World Wide Web Consortium.
;;;
;;; If you know HTML quite well and only need to look up some specific
;;; tag, have a look at the very compact HTML 3.2 Short Reference at
;;; http://fsinfo.cs.uni-sb.de/~lynx/help/html32.html
;;; 
;;; ------------------------- WHAT HTML32-MODE IS NOT ------------------------
;;;
;;; html32-mode is not a mode for *browsing* HTML documents.  In
;;; particular, html32-mode provides no hypertext or World Wide Web
;;; capabilities.
;;;
;;; See ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3/ for w3.el, which is
;;; an Elisp World Wide Web browser written by William Perry.
;;;
;;; The World Wide Web browser NCSA (naturally) recommend is NCSA
;;; Mosaic, which can be found at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic.
;;;
;;; I don't want to recommend any browser here, because it's
;;; dependent of someone's flavour. What's more important, is that you
;;; shouldn't write HTML documents, which fit perfectly on your
;;; favourite browser but looks horrible (or is unreadable) on every
;;; other browser. Especially they should be writeen, so that they can
;;; be read by text browsers, such as lynx. This is why
;;; html32-add-image always prompts for an alternative text.
;;; 
;;; For more details on that topic have a look at the "Campaign For A
;;; Browser-Independent Web": http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/

;;; 
;;; -------------------------------- GOTCHAS ---------------------------------
;;;
;;; HTML documents can be tricky.  html32-mode is not smart enough to
;;; enforce correctness or sanity, so you have to do that yourself.
;;;
;;; In particular, html32-mode is smart enough to generate unique
;;; numeric NAME id's for all links that were (1) created via an
;;; html32-mode command or (2) present in the file when it was loaded.
;;; Any other links (e.g. links added via Emacs cut and paste) may
;;; have ID's that conflict with ID's html32-mode generates.  You must
;;; watch for this and fix it when appropriate; otherwise, your
;;; hypertext document will not work correctly under some browsers.
;;;
;;; html32-reorder-numeric-names can be used to reset all of the NAME
;;; id's in a document to an ordered sequence; this will also give
;;; html32-mode a chance to look over the document and figure out what
;;; new links should be named to be unique.  However, note that doing
;;; so may confuse references to named anchors from other HTML
;;; documents.  Beeeeeeee careful.






;;; -------------------------------- COMMANDS --------------------------------
;;; 
;;; Here are key sequences and corresponding commands:
;;; Most time the following rule matches: "C-c character" are logical
;;; elements like CITE, ADDRESS, CITE, etc. "C-c C-character" are
;;; formating elements like B, I, U, STRIKE, TT, etc.

;;; ---------------------------- NOTES ON HTML 3.2 ----------------------------
;;; 
;;; Modifications for HTML 2.x to 3.x done by Axel Beckert, Eva Stopp
;;; and Markus Bolz. The code was mostly derived from htmlmode.el
;;; version by NCSA. Because of html32-mode differs quite a lot from
;;; the original htmlmode, the mode name is changed.
;;; 
;;; All characters, which have special meaning in HTML, like "<", ">"
;;; and "\"" can be typed normaly. If you want the corresponding HTML
;;; entity, you need to type the prefix C-c before (e.g. C-c < for the
;;; HTML entity for less than). So you can also use tags which are not
;;; implemented, e.g. non-standard tags like those for frames or tags
;;; from the new standard 4.0.
;;;
;;; Accents ("'", "`", "^") can be typed as usually as a prefix
;;; command, but instead of a character with accent they insert the
;;; corresponding HTML entities or in some cases the entities for some
;;; other special character, like fractions or currency signs.
;;;
;;; The HTML special character ampersand ("&") has also a prefix
;;; function which is used for the umlaut characters (characters with
;;; two dots above) and most other special characters.
;;;
;;; The HTML entities for other non-standard accents (e.g. the
;;; Scandinavian ring) or the for URL's often needed tilde ("~") can
;;; be reached by using the prefix "C-c o" for the ring and "C-c ~"
;;; for the tilde.
;;;
;;; After typing one of these prefix characters, by pressing C-h you
;;; can get a list of all HTML entities, which can be inserted by this
;;; prefix. 
;;;
;;; COMPATIBILITY and CHANGES to "htmlmode.el":
;;;
;;; <, >
;;;   In comparison to standard html-mode (htmlmode.el), they have no
;;;   special function in the mode anymore. Because of new or
;;;   non-stanard HTML tags coming up very often the need for typing
;;;   this characters normaly became bigger than the need of a real
;;;   short short cut for the HTML Entities &lt; and &gt;. So typing
;;;   ">" will insert a ">" and a "<" will insert a "<".
;;;
;;; C-c <, C-c >,  html32-real-less-than, html32-real-greater-than
;;; C-c "          html32-quotation-mark
;;;   Because of "<" and ">" having no special meaning any more, these
;;;   two short cuts insert the HTML entities &lt; resp. &gt;. See
;;;   above. 'C-c "' inserts the HTML entity &quot;.
;;;
;;; SPECIAL COMMANDS
;;; 
;;; &, ', `, ^    html32-ampersand, html32-accent-aigu,
;;;               html32-accent-grave, html32-accent-circumflex
;;;   These characters are overridden by functions to output the HTML
;;;   3.2 Entities. 
;;;   After typing one of them you will be asked for a character to
;;;   indicate which entity you want to insert. By typing C-h instead
;;;   of a character you will get a list of all entities, which and
;;;   with which character can be inserted. If you type a character,
;;;   which is not mentioned in this list, a &, ', ` repsective ^
;;;   itself and the type character will be inserted. If you type
;;;   Backspace instead of a character, nothing will be inserted
;;;   (Quit).
;;;
;;; C-c &, C-c ', html32-real-ampersand, html32-real-accent-aigu,
;;; C-c `, C-c ^  html32-real-accent-grave,
;;;               html32-real-accent-circumflex 
;;;   Inserts a sole ampersand ("&"), accent aigu ("'"), accent grave
;;;   ("`") resp. accent circumflex ("^").
;;;
;;; C-c o, C-c ~  html32-ring, html32-tilde
;;;   After typing one of them you will be asked for a character to
;;;   indicate which entity you want to insert. By typing C-h instead
;;;   of a character you will get a list of all entities, which and
;;;   with which character can be inserted. If you type a character,
;;;   which is not mentioned in this list, a &deg; respective a ~
;;;   itself and the typed character will be inserted. The ~ still can
;;;   be typed normally, it still inserts itself, because the ~ is
;;;   needed very often, while typing URLs.
;;;
;;; ---------------------------- ADDITIONAL NOTES ----------------------------
;;;
;;; If you are running Epoch or Lucid Emacs, highlighting will be used
;;; to deemphasize HTML message elements as they are created.  You can
;;; turn this off; see the variable 'html32-use-highlighting'.
;;;
;;; To reorder all of the link NAME fields in your message (in order
;;; of their occurrence in the text), use:
;;;
;;; html32-reorder-numeric-names
;;;   Reorder the NAME fields for links in the current buffer.  The
;;;   new ordering starts at 1 and increases monotonically through the
;;;   buffer.  If optional arg REORDER-NON-NUMERIC is non-nil, then
;;;   non-numeric NAME's will also be numbered, else they won't.
;;;
;;; HREF arguments in anchors and ALT texts of inline images should
;;; always be quoted.  In some existing HTML documents, they are not.
;;; html32-mode will automatically quotify all such unquoted arguments
;;; when it encounters them.  The following variables affect this
;;; behavior.
;;;
;;; html32-quotify-hrefs-on-find       (variable, default t)
;;;   If this is non-nil, all HREF arguments will be quotified
;;;   automatically when a HTML document is loaded into Emacs
;;;   (actually when html32-mode is entered).

  "Patterns to highlight in HTML buffers.

Because of HTML having no functions or variables and other constructs
like a programming languages, I choosed a fontifying that all tags
appear a bit lighter than the normal text. All parameter, which get an
URL as value and all document structuring tags are highlighted against
the other tags. Also HTML entities are highlighted, but not so strong,
so that you can read the text in the source code without problems.

Suggestion for some other fontifiying schemes are welcome at
abe@cs.uni-sb.de.

May be the fontifying scheme will be redone in further versions of
HTML 3.2 mode.")
